# hc-text
It's color-coded text, where the color is an indication of its average value across a series. So if the possible range are 0 or 1, and the series is:

0, 1, 1, 0, 0

The average is 2 / 5 = 0.4.

Assiging the color white to 0 and black to 1, the word "average" would be displayed as some sort of gray.
